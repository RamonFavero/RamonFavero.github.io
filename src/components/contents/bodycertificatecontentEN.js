corpo:"An all-in-one course with a simple and easy-to-understand language with a progression to a more technical language as the course expands. In addition to all the technical lessons I was provided, the thing I appreciate most on this bootcamp was the focus on teaching us how to read documentation. For every language, API or website there is an official and reliable documentation."
